While participating, it’s important to keep in mind this value above all others: show enough respect to others so that we all may continue to enjoy SLAENT for what it is.

Abusive Behavior

We believe in freedom of expression and in speaking truth to power, but that means little as an underlying philosophy if voices are silenced because people are afraid to speak up. In order to ensure that people feel safe expressing diverse opinions and beliefs, we do not tolerate behavior that crosses the line into abuse, including behavior that harasses, intimidates, or uses fear to silence another user’s voice.

Any accounts and related accounts engaging in the activities specified below may be temporarily locked and/or subject to permanent suspension.

Violent threats (direct or indirect): You may not make threats of violence or promote violence, including threatening or promoting terrorism.

### Harassment ###
You may not incite or engage in the targeted abuse or harassment of others. Some of the factors that we may consider when evaluating abusive behavior include:
- if a primary purpose of the reported user is to harass or send abusive messages to others;
- if the reported behavior is one-sided or includes threats;
- if the reported user is inciting others to harass another user;
- if the reported user is sending harassing messages to an account from multiple user; and
- if the reported user is engaging in prolonged targeted harassment.

### Hateful Conduct ###
You may not promote violence against or directly attack or threaten other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or disease.

Multiple account abuse: Creating multiple accounts to evade the temporary or permanent suspension of a separate account is not allowed.
