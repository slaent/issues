# Terms of Service
I. Membership and Admissions

A. Each registered member is granted one, and only one, username. Registration must be performed with a valid email address.

B. By registering an account at SLAENT and participating (including but not limited to submitting posts or private messages on SLAENT.com), you hereby grant SLAENT LLC and our licensees, distributors, agents, representatives and other authorized users, a perpetual, non-exclusive, irrevocable, fully-paid, royalty-free, sub-licensable and transferable (in whole or part) worldwide license under all copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets, privacy and publicity rights and other intellectual property rights you own or control to use, reproduce, transmit, display, exhibit, distribute, index, comment on, modify, create derivative works based upon, perform and otherwise exploit the messages posted or private messages sent on SLAENT.com, in whole or in part, in all media formats and channels now known or hereafter devised, for any and all purposes including entertainment, news, advertising, promotional, marketing, publicity, trade or commercial purposes, all without further notice to you, with or without attribution, and without the requirement of any permission from or payment to you or to any other person or entity.

C. Users 16 years of age and under are prohibited from registering.

II. Expected Behavior

Do not post disingenuously, or in an inflammatory manner for the sole purpose of upsetting others. Negative commentary and minority opinions are not frowned upon, but members are expected to be able to substantiate their positions. Your opinion is your own. When discussing topis, do not at any point claim to express the opinions or feelings of anyone other than yourself. If you see yourself derailing a thread, make your own in order to keep discussions organized. Do not derail threads around yourself.

A. Language

You agree, through your use of this service, that you will not use SLAENT to post any material which is knowingly false and/or defamatory, inaccurate, abusive, vulgar, hateful, harassing, obscene, profane, sexually oriented, threatening, invasive of a person's privacy, or otherwise in violation of any law. Sexual, racial, or ethnic slurs will not be tolerated in any form and are bannable on the first offense per moderation discretion.

B. Images

Images of a sexual, graphic, or profane nature are discouraged. Images containing nudity are not allowed. Outside of this, common sense and a "safe-for-work" rule should be the primary considerations . Do not spam meme images or any other image macro. Avatar images should be safe for work. No exceptions.

C. Copyrighted Material

Full transcriptions of articles and whole or partially-scanned images (e.g. magazine scans) are prohibited. Standard fair-use policies apply, and sources for particular materials should be attributed.

D. Emulation/Piracy

The topics of emulation and piracy in the context of the technical nature of emulators and ROM images, hardware modification technology, as well as their effect on the industry as a political topic are deemed to be generally acceptable.

Linking to pirate download sites, directions on how to get pirated software to work, reviews or impressions of pirated software, and livestreams of pirated software play are all strictly prohibited.
E. Self-Promotion

All self-promotion must be approved by administration and may be terminated at any time.

Posting PR materials for promotional purposes or attempting to embed referral links in your posts to generate revenue is not allowed. If an existing discussion is taking place directly involving something you are associated with, you may participate in order to answer questions, clarify details, and otherwise engage with the community, but as a person, not an advertisement.

Spam is not allowed.

III. Moderation Policy

A. Moderation of SLAENT and all decisions made are handled by no less than 3 moderators. All decisions with regards to forum management and any other relevant issues are made by the SLAENT administration alone. Suggestions are welcome and encouraged.

We do not vouch for or warrant the accuracy, completeness or usefulness of any message, and are not responsible for the contents of any message.
